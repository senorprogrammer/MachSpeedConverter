    Mach Number:
    
      Ratio of true airspeed to speed of sound in surrounding fluid (which varies as square 
      root of absolute temperature). Mach 1 equals the speed of sound, which is 340.294 meters 
      per second or 761.59 mph at sea level.
    
      The Mach number depends on the speed of sound in the gas and the speed of sound depends 
      on the type of gas and the temperature of the gas.
    
      For the purposes of this class the gas is assumed to be common air.
    
    Usage:
    
      m = MachSpeedCalulator.new
      ms = m.kmh_to_mach( 120, 25 )
      => 0.0962977998319029
      
      km = m.mach_to_kmh( 0.0962977998319029, 25 )
      => 120.0
